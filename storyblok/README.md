### Storyblok Project

<!-- Task for 8. July -->
Hey! Your code is looking really great, but a few areas to check:
- In your Teaser.css: Do you need that big blank space?
- In your Teaser.css: Why is your image stretching?
- Your Teaser.js could use a few more guards..
- In general, you can clean up the project so we are not using any of the default stuff that the create-react-app gives us

- Take a look at your app in the browser, it could use alot more styling dont you think? ;)

Additionally...
- You can implement more logic from the API to add even more stuff in your layouts like humidity etc.
